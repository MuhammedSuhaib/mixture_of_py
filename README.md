##  Introduction

- Python and TypeScript/JavaScript are both widely used programming languages.
- Python is known for simplicity and readability.
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with static typing.
- Both have different strengths and use cases.
- Python is a high-level, interpreted language.
- Python and JS/TS are object-centric, which means almost everything is an object, including functions.
- Both fully support OOP
- Both support first-class functions:

  - Can be assigned to variables

  - Can be passed as arguments

  - Can be returned from other functions

## 9. Function vs Definitions

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

```ts
const greet = (name: string): string => `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

## 10. Conditions in Python vs JavaScript/TypeScript

```python
if x > 10:
    print("Big")
elif x == 10:
    print("Equal")
else:
    print("Small")
```

```ts
if (x > 10) {
  console.log("Big");
} else if (x === 10) {
  console.log("Equal");
} else {
  console.log("Small");
}
```
## 11. Type Casting
---

**What is Type Casting?**  
Type casting (or type conversion) is changing one data type into another. Python has two types:
- **Implicit Type Casting**: Python does it automatically.
- **Explicit Type Casting**: You do it manually using built-in functions.

Example:  
```python
lst: list = [("name", "Alice"), ("age", 25)]
# or
lst: list = [["name", "Alice"], ["age", 25]]

d = dict(lst)
print(d, type(d))
# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25'} <class 'dict'>
```

**Note:**  
- `complex` numbers can **only** be converted to `str`, **not** to `int` or `float`.

## 12. Error Handling

```python
raise ValueError("Error Message")
```

```ts
throw new Error("Error Message");
```

# Python Class 1 - Concepts Explained

## 1. Printing & Variable Assignment

```python
print("Hello World!!")

user_name = "abc"
print(user_name)

user_name = "xyz"
print(user_name)
```

### Comparison with JavaScript/TypeScript:

```ts
console.log("Hello World!!");

let userName = "abc";
console.log(userName);

userName = "xyz";
console.log(userName);
```

- Python uses ` print()` for output, whereas JavaScript/TypeScript uses `console.log()`.
- Variables in Python are dynamically typed, while TypeScript requires explicit types.

## 2 Line continuation

```py
# Use backslash (\) to continue a line.
# Output remains unchanged.
# Example:
print("This is another very long statement that will be split \
across multiple lines to improve readability \
without breaking the string.")

# Alternatively, use "" to split strings without backslashes:
print("This is a very long statement that will be split "
"across multiple lines to improve readability "
"without breaking the string.")

```

### Comparison with JavaScript/TypeScript:

```ts
// Use backslash (\) to continue a line.
// Output remains unchanged.
// Example:
print(
  "This is another very long statement that will be split \
across multiple lines to improve readability \
without breaking the string."
);

// Alternatively, use "" and , to split strings without backslashes:
print(
  "This is a very long statement that will be split ",
  "across multiple lines to improve readability ",
  "without breaking the string."
);
```

## 5. User Input

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
```

```ts
import inquirer from "inquirer";
inquirer
  .prompt([{ name: "name", message: "Enter your name:" }])
  .then((answer) => console.log(answer.name));
```

- Python uses `input()`.
- JavaScript/TypeScript typically use `prompt()` (browser) or `inquirer` (Node.js).

## Conclusion

- **Python has `None`, while JavaScript/TypeScript has `null`.**
- **Python has built-in methods like `swapcase()`, `count()`, while JS/TS do not.**
- **Python uses `f"{var}"` for string interpolation, while JS/TS use template literals `${var}`.**
- **Python string slicing uses `[start:end]`, while JS/TS use `substring()`.**
- **Python uses `input()` for user input, whereas JS/TS require `prompt()` or `inquirer`.**

## some topics for Future

1. **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)** executes the **bytecode** generated by the Python interpreter.
2. **Interning**: Python stores immutable objects (like strings and small integers) in a pool for reuse.
3. **Immutable objects**: Objects that cannot be changed after creation (e.g., `str`, `tuple`, `int`).
4. **Implicit Type Conversion**: Python automatically converts one data type to another (e.g., `int + float â†’ float`).
5. **Explicit Type Conversion**: Done using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.
6. **Sequence Data Types**: `list`, `tuple`, and `string`.
7. **Mapping Data Type**: `dict` (stores key-value pairs).
8. **Adding `int` and `float`** results in a `float`.
9. **Casting `float` to `int`** truncates (removes) the decimal part, not rounds it.
10. **MULTIPLE ASSIGMENT**
    x, y, z = 1, 2.5, "Python" # Using type hints while assigning mutiple variables simultaneously cause and error invalid syntax

print( z)
print( x)
print( y) 11. i**del**
del x removes the variable x from memory. After deletion, trying to access the variable x results in a NameError, indicating that the variable no longer exists.
