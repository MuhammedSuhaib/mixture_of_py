// # Line continuation in Python
// # In Python, line continuation is achieved by using the backslash (\) character at the end of a line. When a line is continued, the following line is considered as a part of the same statement or expression.
// #so only code line break not the output
// # Example:
// console.log("This is another very long statement that will be split \
// across multiple lines to improve readability \
// without breaking the string.")
// // # Alternatively, you can use "" for each line to avoid using backslashes:
// console.log("This is a very long statement that will be split ",
// "across multiple lines to improve readability ",
// "without breaking the string.")
